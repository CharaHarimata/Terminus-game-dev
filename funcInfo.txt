HEAVILY REWORKING EVERYTHING!
again.

[Initial calling stuff.]

terminus.initSetup(<Port>,<HTML script>, <Client script>);
terminus.initPlayer();

['game' will be defined in index.js, so it can be called just by requiring `terminus` and then calling the function]
terminus.game.ClientInit(<resourcemap>,<movement>);

[Cheeky password hiding stuff. Supposedly secure enough, so...]
terminus.obfuscate.conceal(<Readable Pass>);
terminus.obfuscate.reveal(<Encrypted Pass>);

[entity handlers. Again, all functions will be noted in the index.js for this repo. *Tired noises*]
terminus.entity.NPC(<spriteSheet>,<spawnInfo>);
terminus.entity.Client(<spawnInfo>);
