//[DETAILS]:
//Level: Signifies hierarchy. Essentially it is used to correspond to levels in your commands.json file. In this case, 5 is the maximum value, with access to the highest level commands, and level 1 basically executes only surface-level stuff. If a user has an account, they can access private messaging and use points they earn to make "transactions" or trades.

//Override: Signifies function overrides. If a player commits a harmful action to another player, the value signifies how much that player can avoid said action. Mods, at 1, are immune to all but Admin, while Admin, 2, can in turn be immune to everyone. Be careful what ranks you assign in your database.
