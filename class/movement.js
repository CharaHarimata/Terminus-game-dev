//spriteSheet, in this, has to be utilized as a 4 x 4 x 'n' sheet. The scale factor's up to you, because it takes the width of the sheet, divisible by 4, and then applies frameNum as a determining factor for how many segments the animation is broken into. rowNum is also important as a vertical frame of reference. The whole thing works using coordinates relative to the document's scale factor. 

//This function is housed here because it's dependent on movement, so it made sense to keep it here for reference.
function animate2D(spriteSheet, frameNum, rowNum){

}
