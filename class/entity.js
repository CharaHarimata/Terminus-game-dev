//==================
//|| NPC Creation ||
//==================
//Not necessary, but this will define the AI and appearance of any NPCs you create. Same movement and appearance handling as clientside functions, but with pathfinding applied.
//spawnInfo is the only new thing. It defines the passive behavior of your creature, as well as a bunch of other things, including hitboxes, scale, applied effects, etc. Basically a non-intrusive version of your player JSON
function NPC(spriteSheet,spawnInfo){
  //
}


//=====================
//|| Client Creation ||
//=====================
//This will do the actual coordinate mapping and hitboxes for players.
//TBD, but will try to pack in needed functions for this.
function Client(spawnInfo){

}
